# Simple installer for the Icinga software stack

The `icinga-installer` installer is a tool to install and manage your Icinga instance. It is based on Puppet and uses `YAML` configuration.

## Requirements:

 * Puppet >= 7.9.0 < 9
 * Rubygem `kafo`

## Installation

Please refer to the [doc](https://github.com/NETWAYS/icinga-installer/tree/main/doc) directory for an installation guide and further information how to configure the installer.

## Usage

The default Admin-Account for Icinga Web 2 is 'icingaadmin', the random initial password is displayed at the end of the installation process.

```bash
icinga-installer [-i] -S server-db-mysql|server-db-pgsql|server-ido-mysql|server-ido-pgsql|worker|agent
```

From the second run on, the -S option may be omitted, since the host is now set to this scenario.
