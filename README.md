# Simple installer for the Icinga software stack

Setup an Icinga 2 with MySQL support for IDO, an Apache and Icinga Web 2 using PHP-FPM. For Icinga Web 2 also a MySQL Backend is installed by default. To switch to PostgreSQL use the interactive Mode (icinga-installer -i).

By default the Icinga and EPEL repository are included by the installer.

Requirements:
 * Puppet >= 6.1.0 < 8

The default Admin-Account for Icinga Web 2 is 'icingaadmin', the random initial password is displayed at the end of the installation process.

```bash
icinga-installer [-i] -S server-ido-mysql|server-ido-pgsql|worker|agent
```

From the second run onwards, the -S option must be omitted because the host is now set to this scenario.


## Scenarios

### Servers

If your server should have connected workers, you've to configure those in `/etc/icinga-installer/custom-hiera.yaml`:

```
---
icinga::server::workers:
  dmz:
    endpoints:
      'worker.dmzdomain':
        host: 192.168.66.92
```

The example above describes a server with one worker zone `dmz` served by one Icinga instance `worker.dmzdomain` (192.168.66.92).


## Setup

Example on RHEL 7:

```bash
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms

yum install -y https://packages.netways.de/extras/epel/7/noarch/netways-extras-release/netways-extras-release-7-1.el7.netways.noarch.rpm
yum install -y https://yum.puppet.com/puppet7/puppet7-release-el-7.noarch.rpm

yum install -y icinga-installer
```

Example on CentOS 7:

```bash
yum install -y centos-release-scl

yum install -y https://packages.netways.de/extras/epel/7/noarch/netways-extras-release/netways-extras-release-7-1.el7.netways.noarch.rpm
yum install -y https://yum.puppet.com/puppet7/puppet7-release-el-7.noarch.rpm

yum install -y icinga-installer
```

Example for RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky 8 and CentOS Stream 8:

Icinga Web 2 >= v2.9 requires PHP 7.3 or higher, so we have to change the default package module for PHP!

```bash
dnf install -y https://packages.netways.de/extras/epel/8/noarch/netways-extras-release/netways-extras-release-8-1.el8.netways.noarch.rpm
dnf install -y https://yum.puppet.com/puppet7/puppet7-release-el-8.noarch.rpm

dnf module reset php
dnf module enable php:7.4

dnf install -y icinga-installer
```

**Notice**: For some time now, access to current RPM packages on Icinga has required a paid [subscription](https://icinga.com/subscription). Unfortunately, using older package versions for an Icinga server is not provided for in this project. However, for workers and agents, there should be no issues with the public repos and thus older versions of Icinga 2.

A subscription is required, it is configured as follows:

```bash
cat /etc/icinga-installer/custom-hiera.yaml
---
icinga::repos:
  icinga-stable-release:
    baseurl: 'https://packages.icinga.com/subscription/rhel/$releasever/release/'
    username: <username>
    password: <password>
```

Username `<user>` and password `<pass>` must be set according to your subscription.

Example on Debian Buster:

```
wget -O - https://packages.netways.de/netways-repo.asc | apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.netways.de/extras/debian buster main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/netways-extras-release.list
wget -O -  https://apt.puppetlabs.com/DEB-GPG-KEY-puppet-20250406 | apt-key add -
echo "deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com buster puppet7" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/puppet7.list
apt update

apt install -y icinga-installer
```

Example on Debian Bullseye:

```
wget -O - https://packages.netways.de/netways-repo.asc | apt-key add -
